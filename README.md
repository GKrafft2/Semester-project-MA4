# Semester Project MA4
This repo contains the work I have conducted during my Semester project at the Birorob laboratory at EPFL.
The project goal was to teach a robot dog new tricks, I tested multiple approaches both for visual gesture recogniton and audio signal processing (keyword spotting).

The different techniques were then gathered in multiple versions of ROS nodes that were used to deploy the alogirhtm on the robot and its sensors. 

This repo is an experiment repo that contains all the different tests I made, it has no specific structure. Feel free to dig in some of the notebooks as they contains most of the relevant work.
